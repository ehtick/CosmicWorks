# CosmicWorks - Azure Cosmos DB Data Modeling Demos

CosmicWorks is a .NET 9 console application demonstrating the evolution of data models from relational to NoSQL using Azure Cosmos DB. The application shows four progressive database schema versions (v1-v4) with interactive demos.

**ALWAYS reference these instructions first and fallback to search or terminal commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.**

## Working Effectively

### Prerequisites and Setup
- Install .NET 9 SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0
- Install Azure CLI: `curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash`
- Install Azure Developer CLI (AZD): `curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash`

### Build and Test Commands
- **Bootstrap the repository**:
  ```bash
   cd src
   dotnet restore  # Takes ~1.5 seconds
   dotnet build    # Takes ~1.8 seconds
  ```
- **NEVER CANCEL**: Set timeout to 120+ seconds for restore and build commands. Build times are very fast and consistent.
- **No test projects exist** - `dotnet test` finds no test projects to run.

### Deployment Options (Choose One)

#### Option 0: VS Code Dev Containers
- Repo includes a Dev Container config at `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (base image: `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/dotnet:9.0`).
- Dev Containers requires Docker (Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS; Docker Engine on Linux) and the VS Code Dev Containers extension.

#### Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (AZD) - RECOMMENDED
```bash
# NEVER CANCEL: AZD deployment can take 10-15 minutes
# Set timeout to 20+ minutes for azd commands
azd auth login
azd init      # First time only
azd up        # Provisions Azure resources and creates appsettings.development.json
```

#### Option 2: Local Development (Requires Azure deployment first)
```bash
# Deploy to Azure first (required for configuration)
azd auth login && azd init && azd up

# Run locally
cd src
dotnet run
```

### Running the Application
- **ALWAYS deploy to Azure first** using `azd up` to create the required `appsettings.development.json` file
- Run with: `cd src && dotnet run`
- Main menu options:
  - `a-j`: Various database operation demos
  - **`k`: Load sample data** - NEVER CANCEL: Can take 5-15 minutes on slow connections
  - `x`: Exit application

## Validation

### Manual Validation Requirements
After making any changes, ALWAYS run through this complete validation scenario:

1. **Build validation**:
   ```bash
   cd src
   dotnet clean && dotnet restore && dotnet build
   ```

2. **Application functionality validation**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure Azure resources are deployed first
   azd up  # If not already done
   
   # Run the application
   dotnet run
   
   # Test key menu options:
   # - Press 'a' to query for a single customer
   # - Press 'c' to list product categories  
   # - Press 'j' to get top 10 customers
   # - Press 'x' to exit
   ```

3. **Data loading validation** (if testing data operations):
   ```bash
   # In the running application menu:
   # - Press 'k' to load data from GitHub
   # NEVER CANCEL: This can take 5-15 minutes depending on connection speed
   # - Verify data loads successfully
   # - Test menu option 'a' again to verify data is available
   ```

### Build and Test Timing Expectations
- `dotnet restore`: ~1.5 seconds - NEVER CANCEL, set timeout to 120+ seconds
- `dotnet build`: ~1.8 seconds - NEVER CANCEL, set timeout to 60+ seconds  
- `azd up`: 10-15 minutes - NEVER CANCEL, set timeout to 20+ minutes
- Data loading (`k` option): 5-15 minutes - NEVER CANCEL, depends on network speed

## Key Projects and File Structure

### Primary Project
- **`src/CosmicWorks.csproj`**: Main .NET 9 console application
- **`src/Program.cs`**: Application entry point and interactive menu system
- **`src/Models.cs`**: Data models for different schema versions
- **`src/Dataload.cs`**: Data loading functionality from GitHub
- **`src/ChangeFeed.cs`**: Change feed processing for real-time monitoring

### Infrastructure
- **`infra/`**: Bicep templates for Azure resource deployment
- **`azure.yaml`**: Azure Developer CLI configuration

### Data
- **`data/database-v1` through `data/database-v4`**: Sample data for different schema versions

### Presentation
- **`Cosmos DB Data Modeling Deck.pptx`**: Slides referenced by the demos

## Common Tasks and Troubleshooting

### Essential Configuration
- **`appsettings.development.json`** is REQUIRED and auto-generated by `azd up`
- Contains Azure Cosmos DB endpoint configuration
- Uses Azure AD authentication (DefaultAzureCredential) - no connection strings needed

### Authentication Requirements
- Application uses Azure Managed Identity for Cosmos DB access
- AZD deployment automatically configures RBAC permissions
- Current user gets access permissions during deployment

### Performance Notes
- Data loading can be slow on low bandwidth connections
- Application runs efficiently once data is loaded
- Each database operation shows request charge units (RUs) for cost analysis

```

## Common Error Resolution
- **"appsettings.development.json not found"**: Run `azd up` to deploy Azure resources
- **Authentication errors**: Ensure `azd auth login` was completed successfully  
- **Data loading timeouts**: Be patient, loading can take 15+ minutes on slow connections
- **Build failures**: Ensure .NET 9 SDK is installed and try `dotnet clean` first
